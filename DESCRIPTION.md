# Description #

Pytomo is a Python based tomographic tool to perform analysis of Youtube video download rates. We first select an initial list of videos that we would like to start the analysis with. For the videos in this list the Pytomo tool first finds the IP address of the cache servers on which these videos are located. The cache server is pinged to obtain the RTT times. Then we try to download the video for a limited amount of time to calculate the different statistics of the download.

This folder contains the pytomo package. The contents of it are listed below.

### start\_pytomo.py ###


The top-most module that is used to run the Pytomo tool.

#### Usage ####
> Terminal:
```
        python start_pytomo.py
```
> Interactive python:
```
        import start_pytomo.main
        import config_pytomo
        start_pytomo.main()
```
#### Functions ####

  * **compute\_stats(url)** Returns a list of the statistics related to the url. The contents of the list are : (url, cache\_url, current\_stats) where current\_stats is a list containing: `[`Ping\_times, download\_statistics, DNS resolver used `]`

  * **format\_stats(stats)** Functions used to format the stats obtained from compute\_stats function so that they can be inserted into the sqlite3 database. The stats are converted into a tuple. The arguments to this function is the list returned by compute\_stats().

  * **md5\_sum(input\_file)** Function to generate the standard md5 of the file. Done to cope with the large file values taken from Python distribution.

  * **check\_out\_files(filepattern, directory, timestamp)** Returns a full path of the file used for the output. It checks if the path exists, if not then the file is created in the path if possible else it is created in the default user directory.

  * **do\_crawl(result\_stream=sys.stdout, db\_file=None, timestamp=None)** Crawls the urls given by the urlfile.txt(present in the package). The crawl is performed upto MAX\_ROUNDS or MAX\_VISITED\_URLS. The statistical results obtained are inserted into the db\_file.

  * **main(argv=None)** This is the program wrapper for the start\_pytomo module. It is mainly used to setup and initialize the logging and other startup parameters.

### config\_pytomo.py ###


File containing the various parameters and constants that are used for the analysis. The following parameters determine the nature of the crawl.

  * MAX\_ROUNDS =  Maximum number of crawl rounds to performed.

  * MAX\_PER\_URL =  Max number of related videos to be selected  from each url.
  * MAX\_PER\_PAGE = Max number of related videos to be considered for selection from each page
  * EXTRA\_NAME\_SERVERS = A list containing the name of the resolver and its IP address. This resolver will be used to get the IP address of the youtube cache.
  * PING\_PACKETS = Nb, of ping packets to be sent.
  * DOWNLOAD\_TIME = The duration for which the video must be downloaded.
  * BUFFERING\_VIDEO\_DURATION = The duration for which the video is to be buffered.
  * MIN\_PLAYOUT\_BUFFER\_SIZE = The size of the buffer for the video stream.
  * RESULT\_DIR = The directory to store the text results.
  * RESULT\_FILE = The file to store the text results.

  * LOG\_FILE = The file to store the logs.
  * LOG\_LEVEL = Parameter to set the log level(choose from DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL)
  * PROXIES = The HTTP Proxy to be used.(Set from command-line at run-time by  user)

## kaa\_metadata ##

This is a stripped down version of the Kaa Metadata Python Package (Version :'0.7.7').The package has been modified to be used with the
lib\_youtube\_download.py module so that we can obtain the metadata of the video.The main modification was to make it independent of kaabase.

  * PingAvg     - The average recorded ping time to the resolved IP address of the cache server.
  * PingMax     - The maximum recorded ping time to the resolved IP address of the cache server.
  * RedirectUrl - In case of HTTP redirect while downloading the video from the cache server. The address of the URL to which the the request has been redirected is stored in this field.

## results/ ##

This folder contains the result files. The results in these file are listed in text format. It is a list containing `[Video url, Cache url, IP address of cache server, Ping RTT times to the Cache server, Download stats, Name - IP address of the DNS resolver]` where Download stats = `[`downloadtime, data duration, data length, video encoding rate, size of video in bytes, Nb.of interruptions, accumulated buffer-size, accumulated playback , current remaining buffer `]`
