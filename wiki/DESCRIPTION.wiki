=Description=

Pytomo is a Python based tomographic tool to perform analysis of Youtube video download rates. We first select an initial list of videos that we would like to start the analysis with. For the videos in this list the Pytomo tool first finds the IP address of the cache servers on which these videos are located. The cache server is pinged to obtain the RTT times. Then we try to download the video for a limited amount of time to calculate the different statistics of the download.


=Usage of the files=

==Setup.py==

The setup file used to create the python package.

==DESCRIPTION.txt==

This file in !RestructuredText.

==start_crawl.py==

This is the global launcher for the Pytomo tool.

==pytomo/==

This folder contains the pytomo package. The contents of it are listed below.

===start_pytomo.py===

           
The top-most module that is used to run the Pytomo tool.
        
====Usage====
    Terminal: 
{{{
        python start_pytomo.py
}}}
    Interactive python:
{{{
        import start_pytomo.main
        import config_pytomo
        start_pytomo.main()
}}}     
====Functions====
    
  * *compute_stats(url)* Returns a list of the statistics related to the url. The contents of the list are : (url, cache_url, current_stats) where current_stats is a list containing: `[`Ping_times, download_statistics, DNS resolver used `]`

  * *format_stats(stats)* Functions used to format the stats obtained from compute_stats function so that they can be inserted into the sqlite3 database. The stats are converted into a tuple. The arguments to this function is the list returned by compute_stats().

  * *md5_sum(input_file)* Function to generate the standard md5 of the file. Done to cope with the large file values taken from Python distribution.

  * *check_out_files(filepattern, directory, timestamp)* Returns a full path of the file used for the output. It checks if the path exists, if not then the file is created in the path if possible else it is created in the default user directory.

  * *do_crawl(result_stream=sys.stdout, db_file=None, timestamp=None)* Crawls the urls given by the urlfile.txt(present in the package). The crawl is performed upto MAX_ROUNDS or MAX_VISITED_URLS. The statistical results obtained are inserted into the db_file.

  * *main(argv=None)* This is the program wrapper for the start_pytomo module. It is mainly used to setup and initialize the logging and other startup parameters.

===config_pytomo.py===

  * DOWNLOAD_TIME = The duration for which the video must be downloaded.
  * BUFFERING_VIDEO_DURATION = The duration for which the video is to be buffered.
  * MIN_PLAYOUT_BUFFER_SIZE = The size of the buffer for the video stream.

  * LOG_FILE = The file to store the logs.
  * LOG_LEVEL = Parameter to set the log level(choose from DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL)
  * PROXIES = The HTTP Proxy to be used.(Set from command-line at run-time by  user)
